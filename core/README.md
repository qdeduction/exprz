# ExprZ Core Library

The `ExprZ` core library contains the basic traits and algorithms for building expressions. The main library contains several implementations of the expression traits, so if you want to build your own, but don't want to use the already-implemented structures, depend only on the `exprz-core` library.

## Re-exported

The core library is re-exported into the main `ExprZ` library for convenience.

## No Standard Library

The core library is Rust `no_std` compliant.

## Documentation

For more information on the core library see the [documentation](https://crates.io/crates/exprz-core).
